# Harware_Generation_Tool
• Built a tool that flexibly generates hardware to accelerate the evaluation of multiple layers of convolution system with a non-linear function called a ReLU after each convolution • Designed it using digital system design techniques such as control module, data path and FSM • Enhanced the speed by adding parallelism and pipelining  • Programmed the tool by C++ for software development and System Verilog to generate the hardware • Tested the tool by using random testbenches for its speed, area, throughput and energy consumption
